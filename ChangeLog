	o  Made release 1.00.

2001-08-16	Jason Bodnar <jason@shakabuku.org>
	
	o  Patch from Christian Gilmore fixing bug caused by 
	   missing 'use Apache::Log' and removing check for
	   mod_perl 1.26.
	o  Added per-realm caching back in as implemented in 0.03 and 
	   missed in the 0.04 rewrite. A different cache is created
	   for each realm (AuthName) so users allowed access to one
	   realm do not get access to other realms.
	o  Made version 0.05.
