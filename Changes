0.05  Thu Aug 16 17:00:00 2001
	- Patch from Christian Gilmore fixing bug caused by 
	  missing 'use Apache::Log' and removing check for mod_perl 1.26
	- Added per-realm caching back in as implemented in 0.03 and 
	  missed in the 0.04 rewrite

	  users allowed access to one realm do not get access to other realms.
